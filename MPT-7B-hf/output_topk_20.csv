The idea that using a shell company allows you to “harden” your assets and “hide assets” from your government and creditors is false.
It is a tax scam and it is also illegal.
Shell companies are not a new or novel idea. Shell companies have been used for centuries.
In their most basic sense, shell companies are companies that you acquire which have already been formed for the purpose of being the legal entity that holds assets.
